# ethhole-santa-list

Create a user tracking dapp. Build a system for tracking who is on their nice list and who is on their naughty list. Allow for people to pay a fee to get themselves off of the naughty list. Let users on the nice list earn a portion of the fees based on how many other people are on the nice list.

Additional Rules:

- The list owner is not allowed to join any list.
- Once you are added onto the nice list, the list owner cannot move you to the naughty list.
- You can only join the nice list by being added originally by the list owner or by moving over from the naughty list by paying a fee.
- Similarly, you can only be added to the naughty list by the owner.
- The list owner is not allowed to move you from the naughty list to the nice list.
- Each additional nice lister dilutes the stake of existing nice listers.
